    "# Improved Real-Time trailing Stop\n",
    "\n",
    "This Final Project presents an improved real-time trailing-stop strategy. It keeps track in real time of max, min, mean, VOL (volatility), FD (fractal dimension) and the returns ($r_i$) per 6 minute interval. Additionally, the code keeps track of the balance of a currency pair at each hour and also the profit (or loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code does this by calculating the volatility as a first order calculation (max – min). After that, 200 Keltner Channels are created in the next interval using the mean and the volatility from the previous interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $Keltner Channel Upper Band = Mean Value + n0.025VOL, \\ n \\in range(1,100)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "    $Keltner Channel Lower Band = Mean Value - n0.025VOL, \\ n \\in range(1,100)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "    The number of crosses with the Keltner bands get counted during the 6 minute interval and then the fractal dimension is calculated as: $\\frac{nb\\_cross}{VOL}$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Extra info: this is based on brownian montion with the Mean Value as the best approximation for the next 6 minutes and the 0.025 is the step size. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The returns are calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "$r_i = \\frac{(P_i - P_{i-1})}{P_{i-1}}$ with $P_i$ the mean price in the current interval and $P_{i-1}$ the mean price in the previous interval (see HWK 3 explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A trade can have up to four layers. After each hour we check, if our stop loss is reached. If the position is doing well, we add 100 extra currency units to our trade until after the fourth layer then we stop buying or selling. The stop loss also decreases with each layer to protect our profits: 0.250% &rarr; 0.150% &rarr; 0.100% &rarr; 0.050%.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This stop loss gets compared with an approximation of the returns, using the last 10 return values. For example: $r_{10} = \\sum_{i=2}^{10} r_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The code also keeps tracks of the average buy or sell price to be able to calculate the exact profits when closing a trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note that the first 6 minute checkpoint doesn't yield a FD or a return value and these are set to Null, because there is no previous information yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The code uses a regression model to predict the return of the next hour\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The code also implements a sanity check to see if the provided data by Polygon makes sense and is correct and a check for when a certain pair has low liquidity (VOL=0)"
